#### Problem 6: Union and Intersection

In this problem, I have generated two linked lists using union and intersection functions. The union function has two while loops one for each linked lists one for-loop for iterating through the set to append values and generate the list. Whereas, intersection function has one while loop and one nested while loop alongwith one for loop. Furthermore, the time complexity for this function at worst case is O n^2 (quadratic time complexity). Whereas for space complexity, we generated results using three lists and therefore resulting in Big O of O(3n) simplified to O(n).

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(n)
