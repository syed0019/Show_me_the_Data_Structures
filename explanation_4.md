#### Problem 4: Active Directory

Here, I checked if the user's name is in the users or name methods to return True else used iteration (for-loop) to find the group in groups method and to recursively call the function to look out for the user within the Group class. Hence this approach takes the time and space complextiy of O(n) due to number of times the function being called recursively.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
